# PcapPoisoning

This is the solution to the picoCTF 2023 challenge.

1) Firstly you open the file trace.pcap with Wireshark.
2) Then you locate the FTP package that contains the password and the username
3) Then you right-click that package and press follow the TCP stream.
4) Lastly, the flag will be in the second package of the TCP stream.

Enjoy!!
